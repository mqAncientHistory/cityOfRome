    bio: "One of my favourite things about ancient history is that it is amorphic. By that I mean it can take whatever shape or discipline that you are passionate about. It entices the imagination and requires a great investigative and rationale based mind. The best of both worlds. My degree is a Bachelor of Arts with a Degree Bachelor of Science. My ancient history focus has been Rome between 2nd C BC -2nd C AD. My science major was human biology, specifically pathophysiology. This pushed me to write about ancient medicine and their philosophies behind it. I have been part of the NSW Rural Fire Service for over two years. It has since become a major part of my life and identity. Ancient history, once again, allowed me to write about something I am passionate about, where most disciplines try to confine you into a box. I recently finished my Undergrad at Macquarie, and am looking at options for my future. The options I am exploring at the moment are; attempting to get into Med School or other postgraduate health related fields. My studies in ancient history have given me a broad and intensive understanding and application of STEM and other related skills through its multifaceted and interdisciplinary methodology. "
