	title="Cultural heritage and the ancient world: authenticity, ethics, collecting, and 'ownership'"
	abstract="Issues grouped under the rubric of 'cultural heritage' have become increasingly central to our investigate of the past in recent decades, taking in a related group of issues including how we treat the remains of the past, how and why we reconstruct it the way we do, how history and archaeology is used an understood in the wider community, and how we understand the rights and role of the peoples currently occupying the lands the remains we study come from. The Ancient History Stage 6 Syllabus thus rightly includes as part of Year 11 a suite of options on 'The Nature of Ancient History', including discussion of the investigation of the ancient textual and material record, authenticity and forgery, representation and reception, conservation and reconstruction, cultural property and museums, and the treatment of humans remains. While issues of repatriation and discourses of 'ownership' have been most prominent, by examining some case studies which illustrate modern debates over the status or significance of ancient human and artefactual remains, I will argue that the concerns embodied in this section of the syllabus are foundation to the study of the ancient world, and must be embedded in studies undertaken throughout the curriculum as well as studied in their own right."

	title="Re-Imagining Early Christian Core Ethical Beliefs"
	abstract="There are four general issues which need to be considered if we are to be able to re-imagine the
nature of early Christian ethical beliefs. The first is the general question of the place of ethics within
'religion', both in the first century and in the twenty-first century. The second is the social location
of the early Christian movement as a minority within Graeco-Roman society. The third is early
Christianity's roots within Judaism. The fourth is the nature of the evidence we have about the
'core ethical beliefs' of the early Christians themselves. All these issues are to a large degree interconnected.
Most twenty-first century people take it for granted that 'religions' are institutions which have
developed ethical systems, and that these systems tend to align with a conservative ethical
consensus within their society. Religions, we think, are about articulating, teaching and maintaining
the ethical status quo. Hence the joke; if you want to know what the churches think, read last
generation's newspapers. Hence also the deep disenchantment with institutional religion current in
our society, when the institutions are found to have failed in this regard. But was this one of the
central roles of 'religion' in first-century society? And was early Christianity perceived as
'religious' in this way?<br/><br/>
Religions are also perceived as an institution of the older generations, passing on mainstream
ethical standards to the young. But early Christianity was a small minority group within GraecoRoman
society, and its ethical values were a mixture of the mainstream and the culturally extreme.
Though some parts of the movement tried hard to present themselves as culturally respectable, not
all did so, and by and large they were not successful in doing so. Early Christian groups were
perceived by many in the first century as culturally subversive, undermining the fundamental social
loyalties of their converts. The evidence for this phenomenon, and the reasons for this perception,
will be examined.<br/><br/>
One of the fundamental issues for the early Christian movement was that it was a movement
originating within Judaism, and largely led by Jewish Christians. It spread within Judaism, both in
Judaea and among the wider Jewish 'Diaspora', but there it also set out to 'convert' <span class='emph'>non</span>-Jews. The
movement was controversial among Jews, not primarily for its ethics (which were deeply rooted in
Judaism), but for its messianic beliefs and for its attitude to the mixing of Jewish and non-Jewish
peoples in its new assemblies (or 'churches'). From a Graeco-Roman viewpoint, on the other hand,
the movement was controversial for drawing people away from their own inherited cultural and
religious traditions, towards something foreign: Jewish culture and traditions. Conversionist cults
were always unpopular in the Graeco-Roman traditionalist culture. And worse, as the early
Christian movement tried to present itself (over time) as something different from its Jewish roots,
it was then seen as abandoning even that inherited respectability. It became neither culturally
mainstream nor Jewish, but the worst possible combination: a <span class='emph'>new</span> 'religion'. 'New' was not a
good word in the first century!<br/><br/>
Finally, we must consider the nature of early Christian literature. To what degree was it designed as
'missionary literature', directed towards outsiders? To what degree was it directed towards
'insiders'? What ethical ideas does it identify as central in each case? Only by clarifying these
issues can we hope to re-imagine early Christian ethical beliefs in their first-century context."

	title="Agrippina: an historiographical approach"
	abstract="This short presentation will focus upon Personalities in their Times. Option J --- Agrippina the Younger. The HSC Stage 6 Syllabus Guidelines suggest that we focus, <span class='emph'>inter alia</span>, on 'ancient and modern images' of the woman, and upon one particular source, evaluating it in the context of other available sources. With regard to Agrippina it is hard to ignore Tacitus who offers an excellent case study in the ways the past can be reconstructed, the reasons why it is studied, and the prejudices that frequently mark the exercise. Tacitus' vivid narrative will be dissected (with regard to key episodes) and compared with the contemporary (primary) data (coins and inscriptions)."

	title="Pompeii &ndash; reconstructing &amp; conserving the past"
	abstract="The syllabus for Pompeii within the HSC demands that students 'analyse issues relating to the ownership, custodianship and conservation of the ancient past' (AH12-10). This area is something of a challenge and it is with this in mind that this talk is offered. The documentation produced by UNESCO will be shown to provide students with clear evidence, from which they may develop analyses of ownership, custodianship and conservation of the site. These documents have a richness to them that identifies problems of conservation, and the solutions that UNESCO feel will be needed to resolve them. This approach allows teachers and students to engage with the wider issue -- what is Pompeii for? Answers to this question are contained in the designation by UNESCO of the 'universal value' of Pompeii to all inhabitants of the world. The concerns of UNESCO over the management and conservation at Pompeii are also documented and published. Further material from which students can use to make their cases with regard to ethics, conservation, and responsibilities of the Italian state."

	title="Minoan State Formation, Religion, and Gender Roles: Opportunities for Discussion and Debate within the Classroom"
	abstract="How did the amazingly diverse, and yet interwoven, Minoan landscape of towns, villas, peak sanctuaries, cave sanctuaries, and palatial sites come into being? This is a question that scholars have been trying to answer for over a hundred years. Theories have ranged from Evans's idea that great migrations of people came from the East; through Renfrew's proposal that the elite were able to capitalize on the domestic cultivation of the Mediterranean triad: vines, olives, and wheat; to Halstead's Social Storage theory. Most recently, the focus has been on religion as the force that Minoan elites used to legitimize their ascendency to power, as well as the key to maintaining it. The iconography of Minoan frescoes and the images on their detailed signet rings show that both the male and the female elements were important in Minoan cult practice, and the question of whether it was a male or female personage who sat on the throne at Knossos remains an open question. <br/><br/>Reviewing the different theories on Minoan state formation and following that up with the question of 'Who sat on the throne at Knossos?' serves many pedagogical aims. It can be used as a jumping off point for discussing a multitude of topics recommended in the Ancient History Stage 6 Syllabus, including Minoan religion, economy, social structure, political organization, and gender roles. In addition to this though, it also gives students a chance to see how scholarly thinking on a question as key as state formation can change as new information is discovered and as the viewpoints of our own society changes. Also, the question of 'Who sat on the throne?' opens up the possibility of real debate among the students, debate that can be grounded in iconographic and archaeological evidence."

	title="Sacred Texts and Writings on the Meaning of Dreams: the Qur'an and Hadith compared with Biblical Teachings (SoR)"
	abstract="Divine relevation through dreams was a principal belief of early Judaism, early Christianity and early Islam. Thus it is not surprising that the sacred texts of all three included instructions on how to discern true dreams from false ones. At the same time, they generally condemned telling the future (divination) by dreams. This paper compares the teachings on divinely-inspired dreams and their interpretation in the Qur'an and its commentaries in the form of hadith (sayings of the Prophet) with those found in the Hebrew and Christian scriptures. In closing I consider the broader relevance of dream interpretation in a cross-cultural context today."

	abstract="Lycurgus is a key figure in the history of Sparta. He is said to have been the great political and social reformer who made Sparta and the Spartans what they were. This paper will take Lycurgus as a case study and explore methodological approaches to the treatment of the Lycurgus legend with a focus on the handling of the ancient evidence."

	title="Silver and Sandals: Social Justice and the Hebrew Bible (SoR)"
	abstract="In the opening chapters of the Book of Amos, the prophet gives an angry polemic against Israel for selling the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes. The focus on social justice in Amos reflects the centrality of ethics in the Hebrew Bible. From the Ten Commandments to the Prophetic Vision, ethical considerations are at the very heart of Judaism. God's identification as compassionate (Exodus 34), is reflected in concern for the socially disadvantaged in the Ten Commandments and the Prophetic Books, such as Amos. Along with forming a central part of the Decalogue, the emphasis on social justice is reflected in the concept of 'Tikkun Olam' (the repair of the world). In the core ethical teachings of Judaism, compassion and social justice are a vital part of the community of Israel's intimate relationship with God in the past, present, and future."

	title="Strong women and what men think of them - Hatshepsut"
	abstract="The study of women in Ancient History relies on evidence, which has been written or constructed by men. This presentation will examine Hatshepsut, female pharaoh, as a case study of how royal women have been depicted by men and what the nature of evidence reveals about attitudes towards women who held a significant political and religious position in society. Earlier scholarship, which has judged Hatshepsut as the 'wicked step mother' who 'usurped' the throne from the legitimate ruler, Tuthmosis III, will be examined alongside more recent scholarship in order to demonstrate the changes and continuities towards the study of women in antiquity. Particular attention will be given to the divine birth scene at Deir el-Bahri, in which the text and scenes have generally been regarded by scholars as 'propaganda'. This interpretation will be re-considered in light of new archaeological evidence and the re-examination of existing evidence. This presentation will ultimately demonstrate that similar scrutiny has not been applied to male pharaohs, who conducted the same royal practices as Hatshepsut."

However, buried in the lunette bounding Lake Mungo are thousands of traces of past human activity: the remains of fireplaces, burned food remains, and scatters of stone, bone and shell tools that were once the mainstay of everyday life. These are preserved in sediments that span most of the known history of human settlement in Australia and their study is yielding new insights into the changing pattern of life on the edge of the continent's arid core."
