# Crassus and Real Estate in Late Republican Rome

## By Darcy Cowan


*Marcus Licinius Crassus was one of the most powerful men in Rome during
his day, but how did he get this power? Remarked upon as one of the
richest men in history, Crassus used events in Rome to his advantage by
buying up cheap housing that had been ravaged by fire. Darcy Cowan
explains how the particular context of Rome at this time allowed Crassus
to become such a wealthy man, as well as a powerful political player.*

The breakdown of the alliance between the three most powerful men in
Rome would go down in history as the catalyst for Caesar's Civil War.
But how did it come to be that Marcus Licinius Crassus -- a man who had
neither the military accomplishments, nor the popularity of his rivals
Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great -- find himself in a position beside
such titans of the Roman world?

The foundations of Crassus' power were built on his immense wealth.
Crassus acquired a fortune and catapulted himself to the forefront of
the most competitive political arena since golden-age Athens (reference
to golden age Athens here). Through his defeat of Spartacus, he not only
provided the material for an excellent
[movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054331/) 2000 years later, but
also proved that he could use his wealth to muster a significant
fighting force. But the real secret behind Crassus' monetary success
lies in real estate.

When discussing Crassus, it's often common to hear claims such as "he's
the wealthiest man in history!", or, "he owned one third of Rome's
property market" (who says this?). The historical evidence behind these
grand claims are tentative at best, but
[Plutarch](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html)
tells us that his fortune added up to around 7,100 talents, a number
roughly equal to Rome's entire annual revenue (Plutarch 2.2). The
ability to amass this much wealth during this time in history was no
small feat, which may lend credit to the mythos surrounding Crassus'
wealth. Similar to today's mega wealthy (chuck in some reference to
Disney or Kraft etc), he spread his assets across a variety of
portfolios. These included silver mines, slaves, political endeavours -
and of course - real estate. The latter is perhaps the most overlooked
aspect of how Crassus amounted his fortune, but it was how he became one
of the most powerful politicians of his day.

Building the Road to Power
--------------------------

### Making Money with Insulae

To understand real estate in Rome, it's essential to understand the
Insula, a type of residential building which was prominent in late
Republican and Imperial Rome. Insulae were introduced in Rome after the
[Social Wars](https://www.britannica.com/event/Social-War-Roman-history)
as a cheap solution to the influx of migrants entering the city (Craver
2010: 136) (this is behind a subscription). These buildings were
typically made out of stone and were designed to accommodate multiple
inhabitants. They were similar to modern day apartment buildings, though
they were typically only one or two stories high due to their weak
foundations and cheap building materials (Yavetz 1958: 509). (this is
behind a subscription)

Cheap construction made insulae prone to collapse (citation needed), and
the frequent addition of a second storey made from wood caused them to
be susceptible to fires, which often plagued Rome in the times before
Nero's building reforms (see Fig.2). Due to these fires - especially the
[Great Fire of Rome](http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/rome.htm) in 64
AD - no insulae from the Republican period have survived and ancient
records regarding them are scarce and lack detail. However, many insulae
from the Imperial period have survived, although the building style is
different. Two marked changes from the Republic to Imperial period
include Nero's building reforms, which implemented regulations to help
minimize fires, as well as the invention of clay bricks. These imperial
insulae can at least provide a good idea of what insulae might have
looked like during the time of Crassus.

The construction of these buildings allowed rich landowners to make a
large profit off the desperate need for cheap accommodation. One of
these landowners is Cicero, a contemporary of Crassus who owned both
high and low quality insulae. The evidence surrounding Cicero's insulae
provides an insight into how Crassus would have managed his own
property, though on a smaller scale. Estimates of the number of insulae
in Rome are inaccurate due to a lack of evidence, however, reasonable
calculations based on the demand for housing suggests that up to 46,500
of these buildings may have existed in the city during the late
Republican period ([Morley 2013:
33](https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ORahAQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR14&dq=%22Population+size+and+social+structure%22+Morley&ots=HysTAzb5KF&sig=K1_eR1SH8qMmoOXIEtdHXM1gNgk#v=onepage&q=insula&f=false)).

### Cicero's Insulae

Evidence from Cicero's letters may help us understand how Crassus was
able to acquire so much wealth from real estate. Cicero owned both high
and low-quality properties and managed to turn a significant profit from
both. In a
[letter](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=PerseusLatinTexts&getid=1&query=Cic.%20Att.%2014.9)
to his friend Atticus, Cicero speaks of two properties collapsing, and
several others with cracking walls that are at risk of collapsing (see
Fig.4). He also mentions a partnership between himself, an architect,
and a banker, that will turn the dilapidated insulae into profitable
housing ([Cicero
14.9.1](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=PerseusLatinTexts&getid=1&query=Cic.%20Att.%2014.9)).

In another letter, Cicero speaks about his properties along the
Argiletum and Aventine ([Cicero
12.32.2](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=PerseusLatinTexts&getid=1&query=Cic.%20Att.%2012.32)).
The Argiletum was a main road which lead to the Roman forum. Cicero is
confident the rent collected from these two properties alone will be
able to fund his son's education, which involved covering the expenses
of multiple private tutors. From his confident attitude, it is clear
that these properties do not require Cicero's direct attention, as the
low-quality ones did, indicating they were likely of better quality.

### Insulae: You Get what you Pay For

These contrasting examples provide a significant insight into insulae in
Republican Rome. He written evidence shows they varied in quality and
were almost always profitable. Landlords and owners paid little
attention to building regulations and often prioritized profits over the
safety of their tenants (Yavetz 1958: 509) (Not open source). The
tenants had very little power to take legal action, due to the way the
Roman legal system favoured the upper class (du Plessis 2016: 48.2) (Not
open source).. This combination made urban land ownership a hugely
profitable affair. In fact, the poor were so badly done by through this
system that most high-profile politicians actively avoided the practice,
giving Crassus fewer competitors (Craver 2010: 136) ) (Not open source).
Even the crumbling properties inherited by Cicero were turned
profitable. Insulae catered for the ever-growing need for accommodation
in Rome, including high quality housing for the upper class, and - more
commonly - low quality living spaces that rarely met legal standards.

How to Make a Profit
--------------------

Significant landowners such as Crassus couldn't spend their time
collecting rent from each and every one of their tenants (du Plessis
2006: 48.2) (not open source) . He had an active political career and
was often away from Rome attending to political or military matters.
There were two ways in which a landowner could delegate this work.

### Property Managed by Slaves

It was not unusual for slaves to have a strong personal connection with
their master. Many were given allowances, considered a part of the
family, and chose to continue working with their former master if they
were freed. It was also possible for a slave to be deeply involved in
their master's business dealings. Some landowners chose to give full
management responsibility of their properties to a trusted slave, who
would assume the role of landlord on their master's behalf.

This method of property management has the most potential for profit,
since the slave, at least in theory, will pass 100% of the profits on to
the master. However, there are some negative aspects to this style of
management:

1.  The landowner must have an educated, trusted slave who is able to
    carry out all the duties of a landlord.

2.  It is up to the owner to incur all costs of maintaining the
    property.

3.  The landowner must invest some time managing his slave and weighing
    in on decisions.

This method would have been more common for landowners who only need to
manage a few high-quality properties.

### Property Managed by Primary Tenants

Primary Tenants are people who purchase the right to become the landlord
of a property. They pay the landowner a fixed, yearly amount and then
manage the property independently, trying to make more money from the
tenants than they are paying (du Plessis 2006: 48.2). (not open source).
In theory, this method lowers the maximum potential profit for the
landowner, but there are several benefits that make it viable:

1.  Day-to-day and accidental expenses are the responsibility of the
    primary tenant and don't need to be paid by the owner.

2.  Income from the property is a fixed, yearly sum. No variation, even
    if tenants leave or pay their rent late.

3.  Less direct management. Less time is invested than if a slave was
    managing the property. The primary tenant handles just about
    everything.

This is the method that Cicero uses for his high-quality properties, and
presumably for all of his other properties too. But what about Crassus?

Crassus: Building a Fortune
----------------------------

Crassus took advantage of the socio-political state Rome was in during
the late Republic. He acquired high quality property when the dictator
Sulla sold the property of his deceased rivals, and he acquired low
quality property when he systematically bought-out fire damaged insulae
at extremely low prices ([Plutarch,
2.3-6](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html)).
He repaired these properties with ease using a slave team of at least
500 architects and builders, which he bought over the years as he kept
accumulating property. Through this process of buying and repairing
damaged insulae "the largest part of Rome came into \[Crassus'\]
possession" ([Plutarch,
2.4](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Crassus*.html)).
Other ancient sources, such as Suetonius, Appian, and Cassius Dio,
acknowledge Crassus' vast wealth and his acquisition of property through
Sulla, but don't confirm the other detailed claims made by Plutarch.

As an active politician, Crassus would have likely used primary tenants
to manage his real estate assets. However, his use of slaves in the
restoration process suggests they too could have taken control of his
properties. However, I believe the vast number of insulae he owned would
make direct management, even through slave landlords, impossible. The
only way Crassus could lead the politically active life that he led is
by using primary tenants to secure a low maintenance source of income.

As I've detailed, Crassus abused several facets of Rome's real estate
structure:

-   Lack of a professional fire-fighting organisation to buy up fire
    damaged structures.

-   Unenforced building regulations to maintain cheap insulae.

-   Indirect property management through primary tenants, which allows
    for essentially limitless assets to be controlled by one individual.

-   Skilled slave labour to repair damaged insulae.

-   The negative stigma surrounding the abuse of tenants, leading to
    reduced competition.

This combination of factors existed almost exclusively in late
Republican Rome, which means that Crassus' absurd money-making strategy
would have been impossible in any other period of Roman history (Yavetz
1958: 510).

Through this money-making strategy, Crassus carved out a name for
himself in the history of the Roman republic. Even though he's not as
well-known as Caesar, Crassus still remembered as a skilled orator, a
generous patron, and one of the greatest politicians of his era in a
time when skilled politicians were a dime a dozen.

Biography
---------

Darcy Cowan is a final year ancient history student at Macquarie
University, majoring in Greek and Roman history. Ancient history has
been one of his passions since year 10, when the enthusiasm of his
teacher, Mrs. Hildreth, rubbed off on him. Late Republican Rome is his
special area of interest, and he has written many papers on the civil
wars as well as transition from republic to empire.
