The Ancient Romans are notorious for their creative methods of killing
people: crucifixion, decimation, and the dreadful *damnatio ad bestia*
....

However, the execution reserved for the worst crimes, was being thrown
from the Tarpeian Rock, a cliff on the Capitoline Hill that was named
after the myth of Tarpeia. Used throughout much of the empire, ancient
sources mention an interesting array of people that met their end on the
Rock.


Place of Killing
================

The Tarpeian Rock (or *Saxum Tarpeium*, as it was known in Latin), was
part of the Capitoline Hill on the west side of the city of Rome
(Coarelli
[2014](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=-7MwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=rome+and+its+environs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjc783e45flAhWn7HMBHXFAB2kQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&q&f=false):
29). For some time its location was disputed because Dionysius of
Halicarnassus
([7.35.4](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/7B*.html#ref19))
described it as overlooking the Forum (Cadoux
[2008](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20204210?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents):
215). This resulted in different interpretations, but today we believe
it was on the south-east side of the *Arx* peak (see Figure 1).

This placed the Rock above the Roman prison near the Senate House, where
it could be reached by the Gemonian Stairs (or the *Scalae Gemoniae*).
These stairs went up to the Capitol from the Forum and were used to
expose the bodies of executed criminals (which provided a convenient
opportunity for their enemies to abuse them) before they were dragged to
the Tiber and thrown in (Wiseman
[1979](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/4435649.pdf?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents):
45; Cadoux
[2008](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20204210?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents):
215, 218; [Suet. *Tib.*
61](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Tiberius*.html#ref84);
[Cass. Dio
58.11.5](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html)).

No wonder they were known as the Stairs of Wailing.

But not only was the Rock readily accessible from the prisons, its
visibility meant it also doubled as a source of 'amusement' for the
Romans, much like the Colosseum in later times. At the very least the
ancient writers were familiar enough with it that they only needed to
say someone 'was flung from the rock' to describe an execution on the
Tarpeian Rock ([Livy
5.47](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy05.html)).

A name most woeful...
=====================

The Tarpeian Rock was named after the myth of Tarpeia, in the ancient
sources at least as some scholars have theorised Tarpeia was named after
the Rock (Henry & James
[2012](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=CMKs_2DRkF8C&pg=PA85&dq=tarpeia&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY7syss5vlAhX1IbcAHf2ZBpAQ6AEIWTAH#v=onepage&q&f=false):
90).

This myth is set in the time of Romulus and Remus and has many versions,
however, at its core, it's a tale about the traitor Tarpeia who, while
Rome was at war with the Sabines (a tribe neighbouring Rome), let the
Sabines onto the Capitol ((Henry & James
[2012](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=CMKs_2DRkF8C&pg=PA85&dq=tarpeia&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY7syss5vlAhX1IbcAHf2ZBpAQ6AEIWTAH#v=onepage&q&f=false):
90).

image="tarpeianrock/trfig2.jpg"
width="640"
height="471" %}

Different versions of the myth have different reasons for Tarpeia's
betrayal of Rome. Varro makes her a Vestal Virgin, other have her
betraying the city because she fell in love with the enemy leader, and
Piso (quoted in Dionysius of Halicarnassus) makes her a patriot when she
tries to make the enemy give her their shields (Henry & James
[2012](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=CMKs_2DRkF8C&pg=PA85&dq=tarpeia&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY7syss5vlAhX1IbcAHf2ZBpAQ6AEIWTAH#v=onepage&q&f=false):
90).

The earliest surviving sources say that Tarpeia betrayed the Romans for
gold -- in Livy's telling of the myth she asked for what they had 'on
their left arms', meaning the gold ornaments they wore. But there was
some confusion as the Sabines actually wore their shields on their left
arms and they 'crushed her to death with their shields' ([Livy
1.11](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy01.html); see Figures 2
& 3).

Whatever the version of the story, it seems she was forever condemned in
the minds of later generations, who decided to make her the namesake of
the rock they threw their traitors from.

It's all in the execution
=========================

The Tarpeian Rock itself was used for executing a variety of criminals;
the sources mostly mention traitors meeting their end there, which,
given its namesake, makes sense (Sumi
[2011](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41301526?seq=1/subjects): 214; [Cic.
*Att*.
14.15](http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=PerseusLatinTexts&getid=1&query=Cic.%20Att.%2014.15);
[Sen. *Ira*
1.16.5](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Of_Anger/Book_I#XVI.)).

But it wasn't all theirs. The Twelves Tables, Rome's first code of law,
says that slaves caught committing 'manifest theft' would be thrown down
as well (Bradley
[2011](https://books.google.com.au/books?redir_esc=y&id=f4x041s0wlsC&q=Slavery+in+the+Roman+Republic%E2%80%99#v=onepage&q&f=false):
243), and they were sometimes accompanied by those who lied in
court (Cadoux
[2008](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20204210?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents):
216).

The earliest that we hear of it being used as a place of execution is in
the *mythical* time of Romulus (about 750BC), when he ordered some
unfortunate bandits be flung from the Rock ([Dion. Hal. *Ant. Rom.*
2.56.3](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/2B*.html#ref74)).
However, as the existence of Romulus is highly uncertain, a more
*historical* first recorded use (and one of the earliest recorded uses of
a criminal condemned of treason being killed here) was a bit later in
485 BCE.

Interestingly, in 485 BCE, when Spurius Cassius Viscellinus was found
guilty of treason and thrown from the Tarpeian Rock ([Dion. Hal. *Ant.
Rom.*
8.78.5](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/8C*.html#ref50)),
a group of people who had either touched or refused the orders of the
tribunes of the plebs (who, as you may know, were untouchable and
unchallengeable, or sacrosanct) joined Viscellinus (Cadoux
[2008](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20204210?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents):
216-7).

Almost a century later in 390 BCE, a sentry was thrown for laziness
after the Gauls had been defeated and driven from the Capitol ([Livy
5.47](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy05.html)), and a M.
Manlius was thrown in 384 BCE after he was condemned for trying to
establish monarchy in Rome -- one of the highest forms of treason a
Roman could commit (Cadoux
[2008](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20204210?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents):
216; Eder
[2005](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ftcx-5j7rjwC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false):
26; [Gell. *NA*
17.21.24](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0072%3Abook%3D17%3Achapter%3D21%3Asection%3D21arg#note-link33);
[Livy 6.20](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy06.html)).

Following these events the next time we hear about the Tarpeian Rock is
during the [Hannibalic War](https://www.ancient.eu/Second_Punic_War/),
and then it is used (or used as a threat) fifteen times until the reign
of the Emperor Claudius (CE 41- 54). Its victims were accused of various
crimes -- deserting the army, escaping from jail, as well as four
different counts of treason (one of which was being a follow of
Sejanus). The last recorded execution was for treason against Claudius
in CE 43 (Cadoux
[2008](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20204210?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents):
216-7; [Cass. Dio
60.18.4](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#ref12)).

So if we count from Viscellinus' death, this results in a time of known
use of 527 years. Compared to the Gemonian Stairs, one of the
geographically nearest punishments used in the Roman justice system,
which was used from CE 28 to 268 or 240 years.

It was a frighteningly long run.


Two-faced Sejanus
=================

Strangely enough, one of the most famous Romans to ever be executed
around the Capitoline Hill was not recorded as being thrown from the
Rock. This infamous person is Lucius Aelius Sejanus. He was the
commander of the Emperor's bodyguard, the Praetorians, in the time of
Tiberius ([Tac. *Ann.*
1.24](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Annals/1B*.html#ref8)),
and the Emperor trusted Sejanus to such a degree he described him as
'the partner of \[his\] labours' ([Tac. *Ann.*
4.2](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Annals/4A*.html#ref6)).

But, it seems Tiberius' trust was misplaced.

When Tiberius' son, Drusus, was poisoned the ancient sources painted
Sejanus as the primary suspect. Although it is important to look at them
critically as they could also be trying to slander his memory, there are
other instances of deception. After Tiberius left Rome to live on Capri,
Sejanus purged the city of his rivals to enrich and empower himself (the
sources also portray Sejanus as a particularly greedy fellow). It
reached the point where many important men of the city treated Sejanus
as Emperor and Cassius Dio reports that Tiberius never returned Rome
([58.1](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html)).

During Sejanus' period in power, Tacitus recorded that the only way to
win his favour was with criminal acts ([*Ann.*
4.68](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Tacitus/Annals/4E*.html#ref25)).
This might be part of the reason why Tiberius suddenly ordered for Sejanus to be executed, however, no one knows exactly why he was executed although
treason is frequently mentioned in the sources. Cassius Dio also offers
an interesting alternative, stating Tiberius fabricated charges to get
rid of Sejanus (Boddington
[1963](http://jstor.org/stable/293155?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents): 5).

Whatever the reason, Sejanus, along with his children, were thrown into
prison, probably the one below the Rock mentioned above (Cadoux
[2008](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20204210?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents):
217-8). They were then killed. Cassius Dio is our most extensive
surviving account of this event and does not describe how they died,
which means we have no evidence they were thrown from the Tarpeian Rock.

Nevertheless, he does record what happened next and that does involve
something even more dreadful -- the 'Stairs of Wailing', the Gemonian
Stairs.

The bodies of Sejanus and his children (his wife committed suicide after
she learned of her children's deaths) were thrown down the Stairs and
left there (see figure 4). Sejanus was such a disgrace to the Romans
that they reportedly left their mutilated bodies there for three days
([Cass. Dio
58.11](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html)).
The bodies were then dragged with hooks and thrown into the Tiber.

Other sources also report a supposed omen of Sejanus' fall when he was still in power. They write that after performing a sacrifice at the Capitoline
Hill, his bodyguards lost him in the crowd, they went down the path
leading to the prison from the Hill and his bodyguards ending up falling down the
Gemonian Stairs! ([Cass. Dio
58.5](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html)).

Ultimately the Tarpeian Rock was involved in this affair. After Sejanus'
death a large number of his supporters were killed in various ways, some
died in prison, but a number were also thrown from the Rock -- and all
the bodies were then thrown into the Tiber ([Cass. Dio
58.15](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/58*.html)).

So much for Sejanus.

The Tarpeian Rock was evidently a solemn place for the Romans. A place
of death, a symbol of the danger of betrayal and unmistakably connected
with the woman who sold out their great city.

Visible from the central meeting place in Rome, it could also serve as a
reminder of the complex history of the Roman people. Its symbolism went
further still. Being on the same hill as the Temple of Jupiter Optimus
Maximus, a symbol of their power, the Rock shows how the Roman Empire
and violence were inexorably connected.
