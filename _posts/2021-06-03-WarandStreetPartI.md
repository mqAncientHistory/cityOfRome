Named after the battle of Agincourt fought between England and France during the 100 years war. The street connects to epping road and is located south west of Macquarie University campus.

The battle of Agincourt was fought on 25 October 1415 between the Kingdom of England led by Henry V and the Kingdom of France led by Charles I d'Albret and other French Nobles. The battle saw a force of 6-8 thousand English troops overcome 14-15 thousand French troops. The English outnumbered and less well equipped than their french counterparts won the battle with careful use of terrain which was muddy and slippery due to both rainfall the night before as well as being torn up by the mounted French knights. Alongside careful planning and the use of large numbers of longbowmen, the English won a decisive defeat. The battle is noticeable as it not only saw a smaller army overcome a larger one but the use of archers to wipe out a large portion of France's noble mounted knights saw a shift in warfare over the next decades.
